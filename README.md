|<p><h2>**Overview**</h2></p><p>The TMS (Texas Microcomputer System) series of processors is a family of digital signal processors (DSPs) developed by Texas Instruments (TI) a leading semiconductor company. The TMS processors have been widely used in various applications, including audio and video processing, telecommunications, industrial automation, and automotive systems.</p><p>The TMS series family tree showcases the evolution and advancements in DSP technology over the years. It spans multiple generations, each introducing new features and improvements to cater to the growing demands of signal processing applications. TMS series family tree encompasses several generations of DSP processors developed by Texas Instruments. The C5000, C6000, and C7000 families are part of this lineage, each tailored for specific performance, power, and application requirements. Understanding the architecture and capabilities of these legacy TMS processors provides insights into the evolution of digital signal processing technology and its diverse applications across industries.</p><p>**General architecture of TMS processors**</p><p>**Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** TMS processors feature a specialized Instruction Set Architecture tailored for efficient digital signal processing. The ISA includes a wide range of instructions for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), logical operations, data movement (load, store), control flow (branching, looping), and specialized signal processing operations (e.g., multiply-accumulate - MAC). The ISA is designed to support the unique requirements of signal processing algorithms. The ISA incorporates fixed or variable-length instruction formats, various addressing modes for memory access, and a set of registers for data storage. It also includes mechanisms for exception handling to ensure reliable operation. The ISA in TMS processors enables developers to write optimized code and maximize the performance of the processors in signal processing applications. The ISA of TMS processors utilizes *specific encoding formats* to represent instructions. These encoding formats determine how instructions are represented in binary form and how operands and other information are encoded within the instruction word. The encoding formats are designed to optimize code density, minimize instruction length, and support efficient decoding and execution. TMS processors include mechanisms to handle exceptional events during program execution, such as arithmetic errors, memory access violations, or external interrupts. The ISA defines instructions and mechanisms to manage and handle exceptions, enabling reliable and robust operation in signal processing applications.</p><p></p><p>**Memory Hierarchy:** TMS processors typically incorporate a memory hierarchy that enables efficient data access and storage. The memory hierarchy consists of multiple levels, including on-chip memory (registers, cache), external memory (RAM), and possibly off-chip memory (e.g., flash memory). The on-chip memory provides fast access to frequently used data and instructions, while external memory provides larger storage capacity. The memory hierarchy in TMS processors aims to exploit the trade-off between speed and capacity. Register files offer the fastest access but have limited capacity, while cache memory provides faster access than external RAM but has smaller capacity. The external RAM and off-chip memory provide larger storage capacity but with higher latency. By utilizing the memory hierarchy effectively, TMS processors optimize data access, reduce memory latency, and enhance overall system performance in signal processing applications.</p><p></p><p>**Parallelism:** Parallelism is a fundamental aspect of TMS processor architecture to achieve high-performance signal processing.
